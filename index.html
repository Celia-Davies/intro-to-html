    <h2>About Me!</h2>

    <img src="images/test7.png" alt="photo of celia davies wearing basket and clay-made turnips on head">

        <p>I love collecting things and visiting antique stores to feed my shopping addiction. Some of my favourite
        things to collect includes tamagotchis, old planters, and pretty much anything strange that catches my eye.</p>

        <p>In my free time, you will often see me chilling at my home with my two cats Tofu and Miso and playing the Sims 2 (I have put <em>way</em> too many hours
        into that game). I am a passionate graphic designer and have been perfecting my 3D art skills for the past couple of years (although I am still super beginner). In the future, I hope to
        put my graphic skills to use in my own business and for other entrepreneurs!</p>
